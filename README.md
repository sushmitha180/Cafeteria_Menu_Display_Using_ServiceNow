## 📉 Problem Statement
Before this system, cafeteria management relied on manual, analog processes which led to several operational inefficiencies:

| Legacy Method | Pain Points |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Manual Whiteboards** | Prone to errors, hard to read, and difficult to update mid-service. |
| **Printed Menus** | Costly, wasteful, and immediately outdated if an item ran out. |
| **No Centralized Record** | Data was siloed; no way to analyze popular dishes or pricing trends. |
| **No Historical Tracking** | Impossible to look back at previous weeks for planning or auditing. |

## 🚀 The Solution
By migrating these processes to ServiceNow, the system eliminates manual updates and provides a **historical audit trail**. This allows management to track menu performance over time while ensuring users always have the most accurate information in the palm of their hand.
